# CVE Lab for Ruby on Rails

This lab lets you run different Ruby on Rails versions with Docker, to assist with penetration testing and CVE research.

To build the lab for a CVE, pinned to a specific rails version:

    $ CVE=CVE-2019-5418 RAILS_VERSION=5.2.1 make lab

This should spin up the container and make it available on localhost:3000
